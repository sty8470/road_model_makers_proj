Help on module vtk.util.numpy_support in vtk.util:
NAME
    vtk.util.numpy_support
DESCRIPTION
    This module adds support to easily import and export NumPy
    (http://numpy.scipy.org) arrays into/out of VTK arrays.  The code is
    loosely based on TVTK (https://svn.enthought.com/enthought/wiki/TVTK).

    This code depends on an addition to the VTK data arrays made by Berk
    Geveci to make it support Python's buffer protocol (on Feb. 15, 2008).

    The main functionality of this module is provided by the two functions:
        numpy_to_vtk,
        vtk_to_numpy.


    Caveats:
    --------

     - Bit arrays in general do not have a numpy equivalent and are not
       supported.  Char arrays are also not easy to handle and might not
       work as you expect.  Patches welcome.

     - You need to make sure you hold a reference to a Numpy array you want
       to import into VTK.  If not you'll get a segfault (in the best case).
       The same holds in reverse when you convert a VTK array to a numpy
       array -- don't delete the VTK array.


    Created by Prabhu Ramachandran in Feb. 2008.
FUNCTIONS
    create_vtk_array(vtk_arr_type)
        Internal function used to create a VTK data array from another
        VTK array given the VTK array type.

    get_numpy_array_type(vtk_array_type)
        Returns a numpy array typecode given a VTK array type.

    get_vtk_array_type(numpy_array_type)
        Returns a VTK typecode given a numpy array.

    get_vtk_to_numpy_typemap()
        Returns the VTK array type to numpy array type mapping.

    numpy_to_vtk(num_array, deep=0, array_type=None)
        Converts a real numpy Array to a VTK array object.

        This function only works for real arrays.
        Complex arrays are NOT handled.  It also works for multi-component
        arrays.  However, only 1, and 2 dimensional arrays are supported.
        This function is very efficient, so large arrays should not be a
        problem.

        If the second argument is set to 1, the array is deep-copied from
        from numpy. This is not as efficient as the default behavior
        (shallow copy) and uses more memory but detaches the two arrays
        such that the numpy array can be released.

        WARNING: You must maintain a reference to the passed numpy array, if
        the numpy data is gc'd and VTK will point to garbage which will in
        the best case give you a segfault.

        Parameters:

        num_array
          a 1D or 2D, real numpy array.

    numpy_to_vtkIdTypeArray(num_array, deep=0)

    vtk_to_numpy(vtk_array)
        Converts a VTK data array to a numpy array.

        Given a subclass of vtkDataArray, this function returns an
        appropriate numpy array containing the same data -- it actually
        points to the same data.

        WARNING: This does not work for bit arrays.

        Parameters

        vtk_array
          The VTK data array to be converted.
DATA
    VTK_ID_TYPE_SIZE = 8
    VTK_LONG_TYPE_SIZE = 4
